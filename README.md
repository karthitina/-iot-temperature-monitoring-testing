# IoT Temperature Monitoring System - Manual Testing
## Overview
This project demonstrates the manual testing of an IoT Temperature
Monitoring System. The system monitors temperature readings from sensors
and sends the data to the cloud. This repository includes test cases,
results, and documentation of the testing process.
## Features Tested
- Functional testing of the temperature sensor and cloud communication.
- Boundary testing for extreme temperature conditions.
- Compatibility testing with different cloud services.
## Directory Structure
- `test-cases/`: Contains the detailed test cases for functional, boundary,
and compatibility testing.
- `test-results/`: Test execution results with pass/fail statuses and logs.
- `setup/`: Information on how to set up the test environment.
- `logs/`: Detailed logs from the test runs.
- `images/`: Diagrams or screenshots showing the setup and test
environment.
## Getting Started
Follow the instructions in the `setup/` folder to recreate the test
environment.
