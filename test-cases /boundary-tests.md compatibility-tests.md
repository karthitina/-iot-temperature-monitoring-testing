# Boundary Test Cases - IoT Temperature Monitoring System
## Test Case 1: Test Maximum Temperature
- **Objective:** Test the system's performance at the maximum supported
temperature.
- **Preconditions:** Sensor connected and system operational.
- **Steps:**
 1. Expose the sensor to its maximum rated temperature (e.g., 100Â°C).
 2. Monitor the sensor and cloud for data updates.
