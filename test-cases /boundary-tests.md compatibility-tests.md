# Boundary Test Cases - IoT Temperature Monitoring System
## Test Case 1: Test Maximum Temperature
- **Objective:** Test the system's performance at the maximum supported
temperature.
- **Preconditions:** Sensor connected and system operational.
- **Steps:**
 1. Expose the sensor to its maximum rated temperature (e.g., 100°C).
 2. Monitor the sensor and cloud for data updates.
 3. - **Expected Result:** Sensor should provide valid data until reaching
maximum threshold.
## Test Case 2: Test Minimum Temperature
- **Objective:** Test the system at the minimum temperature.
- **Preconditions:** Sensor and system operational.
- **Steps:**
 1. Expose the sensor to its minimum rated temperature (e.g., -20°C).
 2. Monitor the sensor and cloud for data updates.
- **Expected Result:** Sensor should provide valid data at the lowest
threshold.
